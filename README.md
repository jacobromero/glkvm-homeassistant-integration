# GL.iNet KVM Integration for Home Assistant

[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-41BDF5.svg)](https://github.com/hacs/integration)

This is a custom integration for Home Assistant to monitor and control GL.iNet KVM devices.

**Note:** This project is a fork of [adamoutler/pikvm-homeassistant-integration](https://github.com/adamoutler/pikvm-homeassistant-integration), adapted for GL.iNet KVM devices.   
## Features

- ATX power controls (Power On, Power Off, Reset)
- Monitor power state
- Monitor HDD activity

## Installation

### HACS (Home Assistant Community Store)

1. Ensure that HACS is installed and configured in your Home Assistant setup. If not, follow the instructions [here](https://hacs.xyz/docs/use/).
2. Go to the HACS panel in Home Assistant.
3. Click on the "Integrations" tab.
4. Click on the three dots in the top right corner and select "Custom repositories".
5. Add this repository URL: `https://github.com/Scalegj/glkvm-homeassistant-integration` and select "Integration" as the category.
6. Find "GLiNet KVM" in the list and click "Install".
7. Restart Home Assistant.

### Manual Installation

1. Download the `custom_components` folder from this repository.
2. Copy the `glkvm` folder into your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory.
3. Restart Home Assistant.

## Configuration

### Adding GLKVM Integration via Home Assistant UI

1. Go to the Home Assistant UI.
2. Navigate to **Configuration** -> **Devices & Services**.
3. Click the **Add Integration** button.
4. Search for "GLiNet KVM".
5. Follow the setup wizard to configure your GLKVM device.

### Configuration Options

- **URL**: The URL or IP address of your GLKVM device.
- **Username**: The username to authenticate with your GLKVM device (default: `admin`).
- **Password**: The password to authenticate with your GLKVM device.

### Comet-x (GL-RM4PE) multi-device support

The Comet-x quad-port KVM manages up to 4 target devices. The integration
creates **one config entry per target port**: when a multi-port device is
detected (via `GET /api/switch`), a "Select target device" step lists the
available ports (1–4). Add the integration once per port you want to
control; each port appears as its own device in Home Assistant
(`<name> (Port N)`) with its own power sensor, power switch, and
power/reset buttons.

Notes:

- Power control for a port goes through the port-scoped
  `POST /api/switch/atx/power?port=N` / `.../click?port=N` routes, so
  `set_active` routing is not required for ATX actions.
- Power state is read from the per-unit ATX arrays in `GET /api/switch`
  when channels are registered on the KVM. Until then, the integration
  falls back to the single-device `GET /api/atx` state and only reports
  it for the entry whose port is currently active — other ports show
  unavailable rather than another machine's state.
- ATX operations are momentary (simulated button press): state settles a
  few seconds after a command, and a second command issued too quickly
  returns `409 AtxIsBusyError`, which the integration retries with
  backoff automatically.
- The GL-ATXPC add-on board must be wired to each target's front-panel
  headers for power control to have any effect.
- You can change an entry's target port from the integration's Configure
  (options) dialog.

## Usage

Once the GLKVM integration is added and configured, you will have sensors and controls available in Home Assistant:

### Sensors
- **Power State** - Shows if the connected system is on or off
- **HDD Activity** - Shows disk activity status

### Buttons
- **Power On** - Short press power button
- **Power Off** - Short press power button
- **Power Off (Long Press)** - Force power off
- **Reset** - Short press reset button
- **Reset (Long Press)** - Force reset

## Troubleshooting

* Ensure your GLKVM device is accessible from your Home Assistant instance.
* Make sure you have provided the correct URL, username, and password.
* Check the Home Assistant logs for any error messages related to the GLKVM integration.
